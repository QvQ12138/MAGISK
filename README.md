1. Wait for the action to complete and download the artifact
    ![Download](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/artifact-drop-down-updated.png)
1. Unzip the artifact
    - The size shown in the webpage is uncompressed size and the zip you download will be compressed. So the size of the zip will be much less than the size shown in the webpage.
1. Right-click `Install.ps1` and select `Run with PowerShell`
    - If you previously have a MagiskOnWSA installation, it will automatically uninstall the previous while **preserving all userdata** and install the new one, so don't worry about your data.
    - If you have an official WSA installation, you should uninstall it first. (In case you want to preserve your data, you can backup `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\userdata.vhdx` before uninstallation and restore it after installation.)
1. Magisk/Play store will be launched. Enjoy by installing LSPosed-zygisk with zygisk enabled or Riru and LSPosed-riru
